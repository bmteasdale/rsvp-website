While gifts are appreciated, please know that your well wishes and presence is a present enough. We are fortunate enough to already have nearly everything we need for this new chapter together. Although we have not registered for gifts, we are currently renovating our first home together. If you feel you would like to help, gift cards to Kent or Home Depot would be greatly appreciated.</p>
